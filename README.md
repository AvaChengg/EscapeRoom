# EscapeRoom
 
 ## Introduce
 I have learned C++ in these 3 months and it's my small project to practice skills. I spend two days finishing it, so the code is messy. </br>

 ## Gameplay Rules
 * Don't hit the spike which is '#' </br>
 * Find the key which is '1' to escape </br>

 ## Movement
 * W - going up </br>
 * A - going left </br>
 * S - going down </br>
 * D - going right </br>

 ** Whenever press the key, remember to press enter ** </br>
